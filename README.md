# RestAPI.Contact_list
<h3>Summary</h3>
This is a simple porject to show ability to create REST API in Java.<br/>
After some research I decided to do REST API using Spring Boot.<br/>
I have for the memory based database used H2.<br/>
Jackson is being used to create nested JSON responces.<br/>
Also included it Spring Browser, this allowed for me to test the API with a little bit more ease<br/>

LoadDatabase.java <br/>
This file is a current dummy file to create a small databvase for testing. The contacts are the 5 main hobbits from the LOTR and the Hobbit.

<h3>To Do:</h3>
Test the updating of contacts and add more comments in code for explaination.

<h3>Added:</h3>
Added StreetSecond to the Contact.class as I have an apartment and thought that would be the proper way for a contact. It is just addded but no data in it.<br/><br/>

<i>Thanks to Spring.io, attacomsian.com, and likely other random pages for giving me pointers.</i>
